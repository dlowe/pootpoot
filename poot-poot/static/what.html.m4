 <h2>Welcome to Poot Poot!</h2>
 <p>
 Poot means many things to many people, but our goal is simple: to showcase web wide interpretations of Poot. <a href="/submit.html">Submit</a> your interpretation of Poot and it will be connected to other Poots for all to see and appreciate!
 </p>
 <p>
 Pootpoot was first launched in October, 1997. It was maliciously destroyed in July, 2001. It is finally back, thanks to <a href="http://web.archive.org">the wayback machine</a>, random inspiration and coffee.
 </p>
 <p>
 Enjoy!
