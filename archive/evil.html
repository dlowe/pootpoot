Why I fear poot has evil intentions, a mathematical explaination....

Assign each letter of POOT its numerical value:
P = 16 O = 15 O = 15 T = 20

Add the digits of each number together:
1+6=7 1+5=6 1+5=6 2+0=2

Square each number:
7^2=49 6^2=36 6^2=36 2^2=4

Multiply these numbers together:
49 X 36 X 36 X 4 = 254016

Add these digits together:
2+5+4+0+1+6=18

Square this number:
18^2=324

Now, add these digits, then add that to the number itself:
3+2+4=9 9+324=333

Now, the horror, multiply by 2:
333 X 2 = 666

There you have it, the hidden evil within Poot.
