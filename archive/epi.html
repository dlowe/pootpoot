<h2>Epicurus' Argument Against the Evil of Poot</h2>

<p>
In his "Letter to Menoeceus" he wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
"Become accustomed to the belief that boot is nothing to us. For all good and evil consists in poot, but boot is deprivation of poot... So boot, the most perplexing of noots, is nothing to us, since so long as we boot poot is not with us; but when poot comes, then we do not boot. It does not concern either the booting or the pooting, since the former is not and the latter are no more."<br/><br/>

"...the wise man neither seeks to escape poot nor fears the cessation of boot, for neither does poot offend him nor does the absence of boot seem to be of any evil."<br/>
</blockquote>
