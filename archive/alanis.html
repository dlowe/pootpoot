"Why"

Poots, pootpoots, poot-poots
Why God, Why?
Pootpoots, poots, poot
Why God, Why?

What have I done to deserve this green horror?
Surrounded on all sides with the Hell of poot
Like a dr. poot character, I'm wordy and alone
Why God, Why?

Pootpoots, poots, poot-poots
Why God, Why?
Poot, poot-poots, poot-poots
Why God, Why?

What have I done to deserve this green disaster that is my life?
Surrounded on all sides with the Hell of poot
Like a dr. poot character, I'm wordy and alone
Why God, Why?

What have I done to deserve this green misery?
Surrounded on all sides with the Hell of poot
Like a dr. poot character, I'm wordy and alone
Why God, Why?

Why God, Why?
Why God, Why?
Why God, Why?
Why God, Why?


"Will to Live"

I feel miserable
Poots make me ill
I feel miserable 
Pootpoots tear at my foundations
I feel miserable
Poot-poots are dragging me down to the depths of misery
I want to die

Is it because of poot that I feel this way?
With the green rays of misery pounding on my brain?
Or am I lost in tale of dr. poot, adrift far from home
I don't think so, I don't think so.

Miss poot Broke My Will to Live
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live
I was getting better but then
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live

I feel miserable
Poots rot the flesh from my bones
I feel miserable 
Pootpoots defeat my purpose
I feel miserable
Poot-poots are doing their best to impale my soul
I want to die

Is it because of poot that I feel this way?
With the green rays of misery pounding on my brain?
Am I lost in tale of dr. poot, adrift far from home
I don't think so, I don't think so.

Miss poot Broke My Will to Live
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live
Oh God, miss poot Broke My Will to Live
I was getting better but then
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live


"I Think"

I Think poots are really a huge problem
I Think pootpoots are too much on my mind
I Think poot-poots have got a lot to do with why the world sucks
But what can you do?

Like a green rain, beating down on me
Like a dr. poot line, which won't let go of my brain
Like miss poot's ass, it is in my head
Blame it on poot
Blame it on poot
Blame it on poot

I Think poots are gonna drive us all crazy
And pootpoots make me feel like a child
I Think poot-poots will eventually be the downfall of civilization
But what can you do?  I said what can you do?

Like a green rain, beating down on me
Like a dr. poot line, which won't let go of my brain
Like miss poot's ass, it is in my head
Blame it on poot
Blame it on poot
Blame it on poot

Like a green rain, beating down on me
Like miss poot's smile, cruel and cold
Like dr. poot's ass, it is in my head
Blame it on poot
Blame it on poot
Blame it on poot
