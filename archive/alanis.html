<h2>"Why"</h2>

<p>
Poots, pootpoots, poot-poots<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
Pootpoots, poots, poot<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
</p>

<p>
What have I done to deserve this green horror?<br/>
Surrounded on all sides with the Hell of poot<br/>
Like a dr. poot character, I'm wordy and alone<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pootpoots, poots, poot-poots<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
Poot, poot-poots, poot-poots<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
</p>

<p>
What have I done to deserve this green disaster that is my life?<br/>
Surrounded on all sides with the Hell of poot<br/>
Like a dr. poot character, I'm wordy and alone<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
</p>

<p>
What have I done to deserve this green misery?<br/>
Surrounded on all sides with the Hell of poot<br/>
Like a dr. poot character, I'm wordy and alone<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
</p>

<p>
Why God, Why?<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>
Why God, Why?<br/>

<h2>"Will to Live"</h2>

<p>
I feel miserable<br/>
Poots make me ill<br/>
I feel miserable <br/>
Pootpoots tear at my foundations<br/>
I feel miserable<br/>
Poot-poots are dragging me down to the depths of misery<br/>
I want to die<br/>
</p>

<p>
Is it because of poot that I feel this way?<br/>
With the green rays of misery pounding on my brain?<br/>
Or am I lost in tale of dr. poot, adrift far from home<br/>
I don't think so, I don't think so.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
I was getting better but then<br/>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
</p>

<p>
I feel miserable<br/>
Poots rot the flesh from my bones<br/>
I feel miserable <br/>
Pootpoots defeat my purpose<br/>
I feel miserable<br/>
Poot-poots are doing their best to impale my soul<br/>
I want to die<br/>
</p>

<p>
Is it because of poot that I feel this way?<br/>
With the green rays of misery pounding on my brain?<br/>
Am I lost in tale of dr. poot, adrift far from home<br/>
I don't think so, I don't think so.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
Oh God, miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
I was getting better but then<br/>
Miss poot Broke My Will to Live<br/>
</p>

<h2>"I Think"</h2>

<p>
I Think poots are really a huge problem<br/>
I Think pootpoots are too much on my mind<br/>
I Think poot-poots have got a lot to do with why the world sucks<br/>
But what can you do?<br/>
</p>

<p>
Like a green rain, beating down on me<br/>
Like a dr. poot line, which won't let go of my brain<br/>
Like miss poot's ass, it is in my head<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
</p>

<p>
I Think poots are gonna drive us all crazy<br/>
And pootpoots make me feel like a child<br/>
I Think poot-poots will eventually be the downfall of civilization<br/>
But what can you do?  I said what can you do?<br/>
</p>

<p>
Like a green rain, beating down on me<br/>
Like a dr. poot line, which won't let go of my brain<br/>
Like miss poot's ass, it is in my head<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
</p>

<p>
Like a green rain, beating down on me<br/>
Like miss poot's smile, cruel and cold<br/>
Like dr. poot's ass, it is in my head<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
Blame it on poot<br/>
</p>
