Poot is a terminology that actually derives it root from early colonial america. About the time of the settlement of Jamestowne near what is now known as Virginia there still remains a statuesque monument that displays the sentiments of the POOT.

When the settlers finally commanded their settlement acreage and boundries beyond ,.. Capt. John Smith communicated in POOT to the native americans whom already had an understanding,.. as a matter for fact many Indian sqwaws were branded with an element of POOT on the lower left thigh to demonstrate the adjoining of certain members and taboos. Those branded with the POOT were said to be faithful for this life and beyond.
