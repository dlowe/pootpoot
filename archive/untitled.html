Weng-Liu was a student of Poot. His master, a famous Pooter was in posession of a very old and antique poot. One day, wishing to see his master's poot, Weng-Liu asked him, "Master, how will I know poot for poot when I see it? How will I know it is not boot?" To which the master, wise to his student's ploy, replied, "It can be very pungent."
